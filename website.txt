There's a first glance release available for Windows and Mac OS X at the download page.

Although there are numerous issues with this preliminary version, I encourage you to try it out and give me feedback at micha.specht@gmail.com external.

Quick usage guide

Click and drag the mouse to navigate through time, use the scroll wheel to zoom. A dot means that something has happened, the bigger the dot, the more events are there. In order to get descriptions to the dots, enter a search term.

These are the main issues:

   1. Links are not clickable yet.
   2. The layout algorithm is still a bit jumpy (especially if there are many events visible).
   3. There's an event dot in the year 4700 BC, although nothing has happened there.
   4. The event repository is not regularly updated yet. It is from August 13, 2009.
   5. Only events from year 1 to 2009 are currently listed.
   6. Sometimes comments or Wiki links/references are still visible or the text formatting may be messed up.
   7. The search is still very stupid, but simple queries like beatles or berlin wall will work.
